# Assignments and Projects of 'Embedded System Software(CSE4116)' 
- This repository contains source codes for assignments and projects of CSE4116 lecture 'Embedded System Software' which I took in spring semester, 2023, in Sogang University.

## 1st Assignment of Embedded System Software 'KV Store on FPGA board'
- The Key-Value Store here is pretty simple and naive because the ultimate goal of this assignment is not that implementing real-world-level Key-Value Store which is normally based on LSM-tree or hash, but that experiencing controlling I/O devices of FPGA board and cross-compilation environment. So do not take seriously about the KV store itself.
- This program satisfies all the requirements described in the guidance PDF. 

## 2nd Assignment of Embedded System Software 'Timer Driver for counting'
- What we have to do here is creating a simple time-counter based on module programming and timer interface provided by linux kernel.
- This program satisfies all the requirements described in the guidance PDF.
