# Simple Key-Value Store on FPGA board
## 1st Assignment of Embedded System Software (CSE4116)
- This repository contains source codes for the first assignment of CSE4116 lecture 'Embedded System Software' which I took in spring semester, 2023, in Sogang University.
- The mentioned Key-Value Store is pretty simple and naive because the ultimate goal of this assignment is not that implementing real-world-level Key-Value Store which is normally based on LSM-tree or hash, but that experiencing controlling I/O devices of FPGA board and cross-compilation environment. So do not take seriously about the KV store itself.
- This program satisfies all the requirements described in the guidance PDF. 

* ALERT
-> **Readers, if you are a student who takes the same lecture in the future, DO NOT JUST COPY these codes. You can refer to the code to help yourself do the homework efficiently, but do not just copying at all. It must be detected via copy detector.**
