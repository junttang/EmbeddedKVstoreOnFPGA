Each directory here has their own 'Readme.txt' which tells you about 'how to run'.

Here's the steps.
1. Move to the 'ootdPT-drivers' and then follow the Readme.txt there.
2. And move to the 'ootdPT-application' and then do the same thing.
3. After installing drivers and an application into the device by following those Readmes, move to the 'ootdPT-server' and run the program (also follow the Readme.txt there).
4. Now you are fully ready to start the 'ootdPT'. Just enjoy it!

* Note that you need your own API_KEYS for openweathermap & chatGPT API.
- In the application, you need to add your own openweathermap API_KEY within 'MainActivity.java'.
- In the server program, you need to add both API_KEYs. You will find where to add easily.
