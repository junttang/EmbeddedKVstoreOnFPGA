Just run the 'ootdPT\_setup.sh', it will push make and push all the necessary drivers(dev\_driver and intr\_driver) into the achro-i.mx6q device (ootdPT.sh as well).

And then, turn on the minicom, and move to the /data/local/tmp. At there, just run the 'ootdPT.sh' and then you are ready to test 'ootdPT' application!
